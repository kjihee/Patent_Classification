6639123	Melanocortin-3 receptor deficient cells, non-human trangenic animals and methods of selecting compounds which regulate body weight	1. A transgenic mouse whose somatic cells and germ cells are homozygous for an altered MC-3R gene which encodes a non-functional MC-3R protein, wherein the mouse exhibits an obesity syndrome at 6 months of age.	Cells and non-human transgenic animals have been engineered to be deficient in the gene encoding the melcanocortin-3 receptor protein (MC-3R). MC-3R deficient transgenic animals have increased fatmass and reduced lean body mass, showing that the MC-3R protein is involved in the regulation of body fat and muscle mass. These MC-3R deficient transgenic animals can be used to select for and test potential modulators of MC-3R. This data allows for methods of screening for MC-3R modulators which effect body weight and associated methods of treating various disorders associated with inappropriate regulation of body weight. The disclosure also relates to a MC-3R/MC-4R double knockout mouse which can be used to select for and test potential modulators (e.g., agonists or antagonists) of MC-3R and/or MC-4R.

Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) produced by  Leuconostoc mesenteroides ATCC 13146 fermentation with a sucrose:maltose ratio of 2:1 have been discovered to be effective prebiotics in mixed cultures of microbial populations, including cultures from chicken ceca. Surprisingly in mixed microbial cultures this IMO composition proved as effective as FOS. Thus, these IMOs can be used as effective prebiotics for both birds and mammals. Moreover, the IMOs were discovered to be effective non-competitive inhibitors of α-glucosidase. These IMOs also will be useful, as an α-glucosidase inhibitor, in a therapeutic application for several diseases, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, caries, cancer, viral disease such as hepatitis B and C, HIV, and AIDS. A diet with 5-20% IMOs was also shown to reduce the abdominal fat tissue in mammals.	aaa
