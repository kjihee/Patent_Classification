5112534	Yttrium and rare earth stabilized fast reactor metal fuel	1. An improved metal alloy reactor fuel consisting essentially of uranium, plutonium, and at least one element from the group consisting of yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium.	To increase the operating temperature of a reactor, the melting point and mechanical properties of the fuel must be increased. For an actinide-rich fuel, yttrium, lanthanum and/or rare earth elements can be added, as stabilizers, to uranium and plutonium and/or a mixture of other actinides to raise the melting point of the fuel and improve its mechanical properties. Since only about 1% of the actinide fuel may be yttrium, lanthanum, or a rare earth element, the neutron penalty is low, the reactor core size can be reduced, the fuel can be burned efficiently, reprocessing requirements are reduced, and the nuclear waste disposal volumes reduced. A further advantage occurs when yttrium, lanthanum, and/or other rare earth elements are exposed to radiation in a reactor, they produce only short half life RADIOISOTOPEs, which reduce nuclear waste disposal problems through much shorter assured-isolation requirements.	2BA

Iodine-125 is produced by neutron irradiation of  124 Xe gas to form  125 Xe and permitting decay of  125 Xe to form  125 I. Irradiation of the xenon-124 is effected in a first chamber within an enclosure and decay is effected in a second chamber within the enclosure and free from neutron flux.

The second chamber is removable from said enclosure and is transported to a suitable location to recover the  125 I from its interior. Such recovery is effected by admitting an aqueous wash solution into the second chamber, whereupon it is heated, causing water from the wash solution to reflux and cleanse the interior surfaces of the second chamber, thus creating an aqueous solution of  125 I, which then is caused to drain into a suitable container.	2AB
6060036	Radioactive seed implants	1.

Past techniques utilized wet chemistry to produce a carrier free RADIOISOTOPE for a seed implant. However, by using the technique of ion implantation, it is possible to physically separate the precursor isotope by magnetic means and further, to physically direct a beam of these isotopically pure atoms and to embed them into a suitable carrier body.

The systems and methods disclosed herein are designed to produce a beam of a single stable isotope using an ion implanter and to further implant this single stable isotope below the surface of a carrier body. After neutron activation, these single stable isotopes will produce the isotopes iodine-125, palladium-103, cesium-131, or ytterbium embedded within the carrier body.

6130926	Method and machine for enhancing generation of nuclear particles and radionuclides	1. An apparatus for recirculating charged particles through a single target location, the apparatus comprising:    a cyclotron having a center and at least one resonator for acting upon charged particles drawn into the cyclotron at the center thereof so that the charged particles increase in energy and are moved along a path which spirals radially outward from the center of the cyclotron in conjunction with the increase in energy of the charged particles; and  target means positionable in the radially-outward spiral path of the charged particles so that the charged particles strike the target means and wherein the target means permits the charged particles to pass therethrough following an absorption by the target of a small portion of the energy of the charged particles so that upon passing through the target means, the charged particles possess a reduced amount of energy and begin to spiral radially-inwardly of the cyclotron; and  the at least one resonator, the energy absorbed by the target means, and the distance of the target means from the at least one resonator are coordinated so that the at least one resonator restores energy to the reduced-energy charged particles after the particles pass through the target means so that the charged particles of reduced-energy increase in energy and once again begin to spiral radially outward from the center of the cyclotron toward the target means.	A cyclotron and a target system containing rotating foils composed of target nuclide to undergo nuclear reactions with the beam from the cyclotron are integrated into one unit such that the foils intercept the orbit of the accelerating beam in the cyclotron. Accordingly, the beam strikes the foils to undergo nuclear reaction therein and to correspondingly lose a small portion of its energy in its passage through the foils. The transmitted beam from the foils gains the lost energy to the foils as it circulates in the accelerating zone of the cyclotron and subsequently re-strikes the foils. This process of continuing strikes results in accumulation of the beam current striking the foils and proportionally increases the rate of nuclear reactions. Since the beam after striking the foils is re-circulated and regains the energy loss to the foils, the integrated unit is termed the Recyclotron. The targets are designed to dissipate the heat from the beam load primarily by radiation. The Recyclotron seems to be an ideal machine for producing neutrons for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy by accelerating a beam of proton and using beryllium foils. It may also be used for generating other secondary nuclear particles from charged particles other than proton. The Recyclotron may also be used to enhance generation of a radionuclide from a target that has a high melting point and can be made into a thin foil. Specific example is generation of palladium 103 from a beam of proton striking rhodium 103 foils.	2AC

"The present invention is a method of separating a short-lived daughter isotope from a longer lived parent isotope, with recovery of the parent isotope for further use. Using a system with a bi-directional pump and one or more valves, a solution of the parent isotope is processed to generate two separate solutions, one of which contains the daughter isotope, from which the parent has been removed with a high decontamination factor, and the other solution contains the recovered parent isotope.

The system with the fluid drive and one or more valves is controlled by a program on a microprocessor executing a series of steps to accomplish the operation. In one approach, the cow solution is passed through a separation medium that selectively retains the desired daughter isotope, while the parent isotope and the matrix pass through the medium. After washing this medium, the daughter is released from the separation medium using another solution. With the automated generator of the present invention, all solution handling steps necessary to perform a daughter/parent radionuclide separation, e.g. Bi-213 from Ac-225 ""cow"" solution, are performed in a consistent, enclosed, and remotely operated format.
